>### TUTORIALS & STUFF
>###### by Zeerats _(with love)_.

All tutorials I've watched with code I've written to practice (from YouTube channels such as Corey Schaefer, Sentdex, etc.).
The code in this files is altered in comparison to what the original authors have published on their websites or repositories (for better, unaltered code, you should probably visit those).
It is highly commented in a way that makes it easy for me to understand and reinforce my knowledge by explaining to myself what everything in the code truly does.
The sole purpose of this repo is to keep a log of my progress with programming, and have a way to acces any snippets of code in case something terrible should happen to my computer (it is at this point over 8 years old)...
